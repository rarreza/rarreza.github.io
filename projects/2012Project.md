This was a school project we had in my freshman year of high school, to create an idea and to give it to a company. We were a group of 4, I did the web design using the free website builder wix, my friend came up with the idea of the patch/bandage, from what I can remember it was a patch that contains robots that can inject you with the prescribed drugs that you need. This idea is mainly to help people take proper doses and to help people going through things like peanut allergies. Our other two partners helped by adding more details of what this patch can do.
