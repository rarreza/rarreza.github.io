Ever since I was little I've always enjoyed using a computer, first computer I owned was a windows XP, first online game I ever played was MapleStory, making friends outside of this island, its what sparked my interest in computers. Video games pretty much made me want to understand how they were made, then phone apps started being popular and I became interested in how them, and want to know how to make one myself. 2016 I graduated high school and told myself I should major in Computer Science.

Throughout my college journey I was still doing my general studies before taking the ICS courses, 2018 I completed most of them and started taking the ICS classes. When we were given assignments in Java to print out something and I did it by myself, I was very happy and it gave me alot of satisfaction, making me want to learn more and to create my own codes.

Now, what I am interested in software engineering is the program we are using currently (JavaScript), from what I heard it is the second most used program, it can be used to make alot of programs and that alot of companys want those people. The software engineering class can also help me to be social, the previous ICS classes I took were all online at LCC, this is my first ICS class where I can talk with other computer science majors.
