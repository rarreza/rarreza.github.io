Javascript still uses some familiar terms in the previous languages that I learned, such as arrays, loops, objects, etc. It was feels somewhat easier, because I don’t have to always name something a string, double, or integer, for example “string sentences = “word”;” but in javascript I can do “let sentence = “words”; ” , let can make it to a string or integer, depending on what I did after the equals sign. But for someone like me, I need to keep working on this because I am in a new type of environment, I use to do all of my ICS test, quizzes, and assignments were all online, and I always relied on my notes on how to solve anything. 

Before classes started, I was practicing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on my own in the last week of my 2019 winter break, just to refresh my head on coding again. I was learning from youtuber “Clever Programmer” at the time and did about 5 hours of his “JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners- Full Course in 8 Hours [2020]”. I haven’t learned new things coding related in this module yet, what I noticed from this module, is that the writing intensive was writing these essays and others for our portfolio, it wasn’t the codes or at least not yet.

	From my short experience with JavaScript, I believe it is a good programming language for software engineers. From what I read, JavaScript wasn’t a good programming language around 2000 to 2010, but was on the rise, around 2010 to now, JavaScript is the second most used programming language, it may also take over Python as most used language probably after I graduate. Its best to learn the best and up in coming programing languages there is, because the languages you learned before may become obsolete.

	When studying for our first in class WOD's practice WOD’s online, and the one with the TA were helpful, it helped me to get a better understanding on how the program should look, based on what we learned or was supposed to learn at home. For me I still wish this would be an online class, so I wouldn’t have to drive to school everyday, it does feel stressed because of the many things we have to do, such as setting up our portfolios, github, essays, practice WOD’s and many more in the future, while doing our many assignments for our other classes. For me I think the coding is enjoyable, because I feel satisfaction whenever I complete an assignment, but as assignments get harder, it probably will slowly become unenjoyable for me. If I am able to pass this class, then I would say it can work for me.
