Javascript seems do-able, just need to brush up on alot to do good in this class. Comparing 
this with other programs that I learned (Java, C, and C ++) from previous classes seems simpler, helps typing repeated stuff less. Javascript is good, but need to keep working on it. New things that I learned from this module, is that alot is more group based rather than individual work, only time we do individual is coding under a certain time frame on thursdays.

The practice WODs are useful, it is hard for me to do under a certain time limit in the first try, helps me to see what I did wrong in the program. I donâ€™t really like the style of a reverse class room but it is still my first time trying this type of learning, feels stressful for me having to learn it by myself, I hope it will work for me.
